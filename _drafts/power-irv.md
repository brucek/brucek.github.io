Politics today sucks.  People are shouting past each other rather than reaching for common ground and commonsense solutions.

One thing that especially sucks is the "First Past the Post" (FPTP) voting system.  One man one vote woohoo!

Umm, no.  If you don't know about the many problems with FPTP, watch this video from CGP Grey, but it boils down to  **the spoiler effect**, ie. when a popular 3rd-party candidate enters the race and siphons votes from one of the major party frontrunners, causing them to lose (instead of their brilliant win if the spoiler candidate had *just stayed home*):

{% include youtube.html id="3Y3jE3B8HsE" %}

He basically walks through the problem and the easy-to-understand solution:  Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) - he calls it "the Alternative Vote" (totally *not* confusing), but they are the same thing.

OK, so either you watched the video, or you want me to give you the 411 here because who watches videos really - [ain't nobody got time for that](https://youtu.be/bFEoMO0pc7k).

{: images}

The long and the short of it is if you are sick of explaining to your 3rd-party friends that voting for Bernie Sanders, or Jo Jorgensen, or Howie Hawkins, or Vermin Supreme is just throwing away your vote and why can't you just get with the program and realize that your ideological purity isn't making a damn bit of difference.

{% include youtube.html id="mPqRirDphuc" %}
{:image-caption: class="image-caption" style="text-align: center;"}
Go ahead, throw your vote away
{: image-caption}

OK then - we should just switch over to IRV and everything's all good, right?

If only.

(sorry Queen Lion üòí)

So election nerds like to argue about whose voting method is the biggest... alignment with voters' actual desires, which is most resistant to strategic voting and all sorts of other crazy criteria.

![Single-winner Voting Method Comparison Chart](/assets/images/ballot/inline/voting_chart.png){:class="img-responsive"}
**Way more detail than needed for normal humans**  
<sub><sup>[chart and references are at [FairVote](https://archive3.fairvote.org/reforms/instant-runoff-voting/irv-and-the-status-quo/irv-versus-alternative-reforms/single-winner-voting-method-comparison-chart/), who are very hot for IRV as you can see]</sup></sub>
{: images}

This chart is a *little* misleading as it downplays a super annoying problem with IRV:

> IRV does not allow voters to always vote for their favorite no matter what, especially in the circumstances where it matters the most: when your honest favorite is just about to become a frontrunner.

That's also super not obvious, so let's go to another video - this time from the Center for Election Science which explains how our voting system (and IRV) can force you to **betray** your favourite candidate:

{% include youtube.html id="JtKAScORevQ" %}
I love this video.  **Definitely** watch this one.
{: image-caption}

The problem is basically a result of something called the ["center squeeze" effect](https://electionscience.org/library/the-center-squeeze-effect/) - basically:

* a broadly appealing centrist
* can be defeated 
* if squeezed from both sides
* by candidates who absorb most of the support from the ends of the political spectrum

![The ‚ÄúCenter Squeeze‚Äù Effect](/assets/images/ballot/inline/center_squeeze_effect_diagram.png){:class="img-responsive"}
{: images}

# Warning: math
{:small: style="font-size: small;"}
(kind of)
{: small}

In this case:
* `R` has **just** passed `C` in popularity
* but because more `C` voters prefer `L` to `R`
* `L` will win
* despite `C` being the best choice overall

(We just asserted that more `C` voters prefer `L` to `R` to match the layout of the Center for Election Science video)
{: small}

# And IRV was so promising...

**Ugh.**  OK, so what do we do now?

This is about the time when usually Approval Voting<sup>*</sup> junkies all jump up to talk about [why Monotonicity is sooooo important](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Monotonicity#2009_Burlington.2C_Vermont_mayoral_election) and how their method never suffers from [Favorite Betrayal](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Favorite_betrayal_criterion) and so we should just shut up and get down with the APP.

\* Approval voting: all voters vote for all candidates they find acceptable.  Count up all the votes - highest total wins.

# Sorry, Approval Voting:  Power IRV is the New Hotness

Let's take a look: Power IRV works exactly like regular IRV *until you get down to the last 3 finalists*.

At this point we have to do something to fix the center squeeze issue, which was the killer for regular IRV.  How do we deal with that?

#### Power to the rescue

So we probably could have called this "IRV + Pairwise Finalists", or "IRV with a Condorcet Nightcap" or something, but what fun is that?  POWER.

(I didn't think calling it Condorcension was going to go very far either)
{: small}

OK anyways - whatever we call it, the trick is to just pick the winner from the 3 finalists by finding what is called the [Condorcet winner](https://youtu.be/bXYQPvU_Oao) (oh, **that's** where those names came from):

* first, run elections between each pair of candidates
* if anyone beats both both other candidates head-to-head:  congrats!  You win!

# But I thought the Condorcet method doesn't always work?

Wait, what are you, some kind of electo-nerd?  OK, ok, ok, yeah you're right - that's totally true.  Much like the rhythm method, the Condorcet method doesn't always work.

**What?!?!  How's that?**

Yes, Virginia:  sometimes there **is no** Condorcet winner.  

It turns out to be pretty easy to understand, actually.  Imagine 3 candidates, and now say that voters prefer A over B, B over C and C over A (so it's a loop!).  Bummer.

![The Condorcet Paradox](/assets/images/ballot/inline/condorcet_paradox.png){:class="img-responsive" width="300px"}
{: images}

But wait - it's OK!  We can fix this too (and in a pretty logical way).  We just throw in a little twist - if we have no clear head-to-head winner, let's:

* tally up the votes in each race<sup>*</sup> (so 3 sets of head-to-head totals)
* whoever has the highest vote count in any race wins<sup>**</sup>

The idea is that by running the 3 pairwise elections and taking the highest total count, we will pick the best coalition-builder.  If one of the candidates were to drop out, which of the others can build the strongest coalition including these orphaned supporters?

This is the trick to fixing the center squeeze problem - if either of the regular IRV losers can combine forces to defeat a center-squeezed winner, they should win - and by taking the highest vote total overall, you can see which coalition has the greatest overall support.

\* In case a voter only ranked 1 of the last 3 finalists, we just split their vote and count it 1/2 for **both** of the others when their only choice is removed (since they gave us no preference)
{: small}

\** We do have to worry about a super-rare 2-way tie, but guess what?  We just found the pairwise winner for that scenario too üòâ
{: small}

## Let's Get Down To It

OK, so we've done a lot of talking, but can you get your hands dirty and try out this business?

## YES.
{: center}

Thanks to [a wonderful post](https://ncase.me/ballot/) by Nicky Case, we can go through an interactive exploration of different voting systems to compare how they work.  I've added a handful of his scenarios here, and also added in the Power IRV approach as a new option.  Check it out:

# Show me the squeeze

Here's the main case where basic Instant Runoff Voting runs into trouble. In the beginning, Tracy Triangle ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} is already winning, and you're going to move the voters even closer to her. Obviously, if a candidate is already winning an election, and becomes even more popular, they should still win afterwards, right?

{:election: class="sim-test"}
{:caption: class="caption-test"}
drag the voters ![Voters](/assets/images/ballot/voters.png){:height="20px"} *slowly* up towards ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"}:
{: caption}
{% include iframe.html url="/play/election2.html" %}
{: election}

Cool, huh?

(Well, OK - except that the problems with IRV are decidedly *not* so cool.)
{: small}

Anyways, now let's go back and see what happens with Power IRV - try dragging the voters ![Voters](/assets/images/ballot/voters.png){:height="20px"} up again after you click on the `PowerIRV` button.  Go ahead.  We'll wait.

(You can also push `reset` if you moved too many things around)

Did you see how Power IRV's minor tweak with the final 3 candidates made all the difference and solved the problems we saw with normal IRV?

![Yeah you did](/assets/images/ballot/inline/yeah_you_did.png){:class="img-responsive" width="300px"}
{: images}

## Nice.

OK, so what other scenarios come up that go all pear-shaped under other voting methods?

The second-most popular alternative to FPTP is called the Borda Count.  You simply take a ranked ballot and add up the rank numbers. Like in golf, whoever has the lowest score, wins.

# The Borda Reverse Spoiler

In this next simulation, you move a losing candidate closer to another losing candidate. Under FPTP, the spoiler effect would split their votes, making both of them lose even more. But watch what happens under Borda Count instead...

drag ![Henry Hexagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} to just slightly left of ![Suzy Square](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}:
{: caption}
{% include iframe.html url="/play/election3.html" %}
{: election}

Did you see where Borda Count had a reverse spoiler effect? Instead of one good candidate hurting another good candidate by moving closer, with Borda Count, one bad candidate can help another bad candidate by moving closer.

Did you try with Power IRV?  If not, go for it.

(Spoiler alert:  Power IRV DGAF about your crappy hexagon candidate's antics.)

![Aww yiss](/assets/images/ballot/inline/aw-yiss.png){:class="img-responsive" width="300px"}
{: images}

Now let's do a little rewind and look at some revisionist history with the 2016 election.  Let's imagine that instead of FPTP we had rocked it out with Power IRV.

By using Power IRV, we **totally** remove the spoiler effect - and this means that Bernie could have also run in the general election without risking Hillary's chances.

# Bring Bernie Back

Let's see what would have happened if Bernie could have run as a 3rd candidate.  Feel free to move him around if you think his appeal lands somewhere else in the ideological landscape:

a guesstimated model of the 2016 US election?

how Clinton ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"} ties Approval and IRV, Trump ![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} wins FPTP and Score, and Sanders ![Triangle Bernie](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} wins Power IRV:

{% include iframe.html url="/play/election5.html" %}
{: election}

You might notice that things got weird here with Power IRV if you leave Clinton ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"} and Trump ![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} alone and just move Sanders ![Triangle Bernie](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} around the bottom edge of the map.

Clinton ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"} can win just by moving Sanders ![Triangle Bernie](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} to the left way down there at the bottom!  What the heck, I thought you said this Power IRV thing didn't have any weird problems?!?!

# Chill, homie

This is weird only because Clinton ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"} and Trump ![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} are **exactly** tied between each other:

![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} vs ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}: tied at 58
{: caption}

If Trump ![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} were a little bit closer and could pull a few voters from the Democrat block (or vice versa), this problem goes away - it's just because our voter model is super simple and we have **exactly** the same number of votes in a head-to-head with Trump ![Trumpagon](/assets/images/ballot/hexagon.png){:height="20px"} vs Clinton ![Four Square Hillary](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}, something that is astronomically unlikely in any real contest.

## OK, but why is all this *really* important?

For years, voting reform has been stuck between two groups of people:

- **Let's use IRV! YOLO!!**
  - I like to feel good by voting my preferences and getting to support my favorite the most
  - I don't know about IRV's center squeeze problem
  - I just want to do *anything* to get us unstuck here and IRV has that mainstream mojo
  
vs.

- **Approval voting is the move**
  - I am a voting nerd and know about IRV and favorite betrayal
  - I don't mind giving the same score to the candidate I love, the one I like, and the one I hold my nose for
  - I enjoy fighting an endless battle against people who can't possibly stomach voting the same for Hillary and Bernie

People get all excited about IRV, then they end up talking to the voting math people somewhere along the way, and they all push back on how IRV is terrible and if we're going to go through all the trouble to change, let's change to something that *actually* improves things significantly and all the initial excitement drains away like someone told them they're about to be stuck on an 8-hour car ride with a group of Crossfit vegan anti-vaxxers.

And then suddenly all the other voting method proponents swoop in and now you have a 6-way discussion that winds up with everybody giving up and just getting drunk instead.  And here we are.

![Greta is not amused](/assets/images/ballot/inline/amused_greta.jpg){:class="img-responsive" width="300"}
{: images}

So to fight off the math harpies, let's go a little deeper here.  It turns out that in the worst case, IRV is about the same as FPTP(!) for reaching voter satisfaction, and it *can* be a little better.  But Approval voting is *much* better.

Here's a crazy chart [(source)](https://electology.org/tactical-voting-basics) showing the results of 2.2 million simulations. A huge variety of scenarios were tested. All-honest voters. All-strategic voters. Half-honest, half-strategic. Voters who know each others' preferences. Voters who don't know each others' preferences. Voters who only sorta-know each others' preferences. And so on. You can tell that a real mathematician made this chart, because it makes your eyes bleed - the really important thing though is that blue bars further to the right are better:

![So much simulation](/assets/images/ballot/inline/simulation_comparison.png){:class="img-responsive"}
{: images}

It's clearly unfortunate as well that being a math dude he ranked the Simplicity axis on how simple it was for *him to compute*, and not how simple it is for *normal humans* to understand how to fill out their ballot.  I'm looking at you, Score Voting.

# Score Voting has problems too
And look - Score Voting isn't always necessarily that great either<sup>*</sup>.  Check out this scenario:

\* not to mention the whole "try and figure out how to rank everybody on a scale with too many choices" thing...  Did I get it right?  What if I scored these guys too close?  Or not close enough?  Now try that with 5 or 10 different candidates - good luck
{: small}

In this case 2/3 of voters dislike both candidates, but definitely dislike Square ![Suzy Square](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}: much less. However, 1/3 of voters LOVE Triangle ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} and HATE Square ![Suzy Square](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}:.

Here, Score gives it to Triangle ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"}, while every *other* voting method says Square ![Suzy Square](/assets/images/ballot/square.png){:height="20px"}: should win.  Is Triangle ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} the right answer?  It's very hard to argue that Triangle ![Tracy Triangle](/assets/images/ballot/triangle.png){:height="20px"} winning is a better outcome here - this is very clearly **not** "majority rule".  In fact, exactly the opposite.

{:election: class="sim-test"}
should fanatics override a less-loved but more representative candidate?

Anyways - I haven't done the math on this, but if good old Warren D. Smith ran Power IRV through his Bayesian Regret-ometer<sup>*</sup> and updated his chart

\* (what is Bayesian Regret?  It's like the computational inverse of happiness.  Yeah, go and [read up on that](https://www.rangevoting.org/BayRegDum.html) why don't you?  You'll get it *right away*)
{: small}

...I'd be willing to bet that we would find Power IRV beats out these other chump voting methods and we could finally build some consensus to actually *make a change* and dump this stupid FPTP voting BS once and for all:

![So much simulation](/assets/images/ballot/inline/bayesian_with_PIRV.png){:class="img-responsive"}
{: images}
Suck it Score Voting - and good luck rating every candidate from 0-100(!) anyways

## Convinced yet?

Yeah you are.  Let's do this.

Tell your friends, tell your Congresspeople, push for Power IRV in your local elections and with voting reform organizations such as [FairVote](https://www.fairvote.org/).

Or if you're still not there, I'd love to hear from you.  Drop me an email at the address at the bottom of the page with "Power IRV" somewhere in the subject and let's talk.

Meanwhile, my fingers are crossed ü§û that this idea gets us one step closer again towards our more Perfect Union.

Oh, the audacity..!  üòâ

Be well, my friends.  Happy voting!
